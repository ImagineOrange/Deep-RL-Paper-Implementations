Requirements: 
numpy,pygame,random

Description:  
A homemade snake game built using pygame. The rules are basic, with four directional actions possible,  
score increasing for every food block eaten, and the game ending upon the head of the snake hitting a wall or its own body. 
This game will serve as the environment for each deep RL experiment in this repo.
